This is another challenge from the OSINT category.
All we get is a photo of an interesting person.
![]({{ site.url }}/static/assets/writeups/EZCTF2022/osint/hue_is_this.jpeg)

The first thing that i've done was to use google image search. 
![]({{ site.url }}/static/assets/writeups/EZCTF2022/osint/2022-05-07_13-03.png)

I clicked through first three pages and found the name of the album (cover of
the album was the same as in the photo)
![]({{ site.url }}/static/assets/writeups/EZCTF2022/osint/2022-05-07_13-03_1.png)

On the same page, if you look closely, you can find information about the model from 
our photo.

If we combine all the information that we found the flag is:
```EZ-CTF{}```
